# Contributors

Please follow the below guidelines for commit messages. Thank you to all the contributors who have helped improve this project!

## Commit Message Guidelines

Your commit messages should follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<optional scope>)<place-!-for-breaking-changes>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Type

The `<type>` should be one of the following:

- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect code (e.g., formatting, white-space, etc.).
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests.
- `chore`: Changes to the build process, tooling, etc.

### Scope (optional)

The `<scope>` should indicate the scope of the commit (e.g., component, module, etc.). It is optional if the commit applies globally.

### Description

The `<description>` should provide a brief summary of the change.

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes include an '!' after the scope and elaborate a bit in the body.

```
feat!: some breaking change description

<body description>

BREAKING CHANGE: <what-broke-description>
```

### Body (optional)

The `<body>` should provide more detailed information about the change. It can span multiple lines.

### Footer (optional)

The `<footer>` should contain any additional information related to the commit, such as references to issues or breaking changes.

```
Refs: #100,#101,etc

or 

BREAKING CHANGE: breaks some interface
```

## Examples

### Good Examples

- ‚úÖ `fix(scope/another-scope/some-scope): commit subject with multiple scopes`
- ‚úÖ `docs: Update README with new examples`
- ‚úÖ `style: Format code according to style guide`
- ‚úÖ `refactor: Simplify data processing method`
- ‚úÖ `test: Add unit tests for API endpoints`
- ‚úÖ `chore: Upgrade dependencies to latest versions`

### Bad Examples

- ‚ùå `added new feature`
- ‚ùå `Fixed the login bug`
- ‚ùå `Documentation updates`
- ‚ùå `Fix formatting`
- ‚ùå `Changed some code`
- ‚ùå `Added tests`
- ‚ùå `Updated dependencies`

Remember to follow these guidelines when making contributions. Consistent and clear commit messages help maintain a healthy and easily understandable codebase.
